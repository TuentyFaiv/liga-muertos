Last updated: August 25, 2025

These Terms and Conditions (the “Terms”) govern access to and use of the website and services available at ligadelosmuertos.com (the “Platform”), operated by Tuentyfaiv with registered office in Mexico City, Mexico (“Tuentyfaiv,” “we”). By accessing or using the Platform, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Platform.

## 1. Service Description
-  The Platform allows managing and viewing information about a streaming soccer league, participating in tournaments, consulting statistics, managing profiles, and making virtual purchases.
-  Some components integrate with third-party services (e.g., Twitch, Clerk, Vercel Analytics, Cloudflare).

## 2. Account Registration, Eligibility, and Minors
-  To use specific features, you must create an account and log in (authentication via Clerk with Twitch integration).
-  You declare that:
  - You are at least 13 years old. The Platform is not intended for minors under 13, and we do not allow their registration.
  - If you are between 13 and 17 (or the applicable age of majority), you have the consent and supervision of your mother/father or legal guardian to: (i) create the account, (ii) participate in tournaments, (iii) make virtual purchases, and (iv) publish content (including images/voice).
  - The information you provide is truthful, accurate, and will be kept up to date.
-  We reserve the right to request and verify reasonable evidence of parental consent and to close or suspend accounts when such proof is not provided.
-  If we identify an account of a minor under 13, we will close it and delete the associated data in accordance with the Privacy Policy.

## 3. User Conduct
Prohibited actions include:
-  Using the Platform for illegal activities, infringements, or rights violations of third parties.
-  Publishing or transmitting defamatory, obscene, violent, discriminatory, hate speech, or inciting violence content.
-  Interfering with the technical operation of the Platform (malware, unauthorized scraping, attacks, security control bypass).
-  Impersonating or falsely claiming a connection with third parties.
-  Attempting to access unauthorized data or areas.
-  Publishing third-party personal data (especially minors) without valid consent from the owner or guardian.

We may suspend or cancel accounts for violations of these Terms or due to security risks, fraud, or abuse.

-  You declare that you have the necessary rights over the content you publish and that its use on the Platform does not infringe third-party rights.
-  Player cards/profiles: you can choose “real photo” or “avatar.” If you are a minor, uploading a “real photo” and/or any content involving your image/voice requires prior consent from your mother/father or guardian. You can withdraw that consent by requesting removal or replacement via develop@tuentyfaiv.com; we will process the removal within a reasonable period, without affecting acts already completed legally or technically.

## 5. Tournaments, Rules, and Moderation
