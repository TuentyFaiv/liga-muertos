# Add Troubleshooting Section to Main README

## üìù Description
Our main README is comprehensive but lacks a troubleshooting section for common setup issues. New contributors often face similar problems when setting up the development environment, and having a dedicated troubleshooting section would help them resolve issues independently.

## üéØ Expected Outcome
A new "## Troubleshooting" section should be added to the main `README.md` file before the "Contributing" section, containing solutions for common setup problems.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Add a "## Troubleshooting" section to `README.md`
- [ ] Include at least 5 common issues and their solutions
- [ ] Use clear headings for each problem (e.g., "### Node.js Version Issues")
- [ ] Provide step-by-step solutions
- [ ] Include links to relevant documentation where helpful
- [ ] Maintain consistent formatting with the rest of the README

## üîó Helpful Resources
- Current README file: [`README.md`](../../README.md)
- Frontend README: [`front/README.md`](../../front/README.md)
- Backend README: [`back/README.md`](../../back/README.md)
- Contributing guidelines: [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)

## üí° Suggested Common Issues to Include

### Frontend Issues
- Node.js version compatibility (should be v22+)
- Bun installation problems
- Port 5173 already in use
- Dependencies installation failures
- TypeScript compilation errors

### Backend Issues
- Rust installation problems
- Cargo build failures
- Port 8080 already in use
- SurrealDB Cloud connection issues
- Clerk environment variables missing

### General Issues
- Git SSH key setup
- Fork/clone problems
- Permission issues on different operating systems

## üí° Hints for Implementation
- Look at the current README structure and match the formatting
- Use the same markdown style as existing sections
- Consider adding code blocks for terminal commands
- Include both the problem description and solution
- File to modify: `README.md` (in the root directory)
- Insert the new section around line 90, before the "Contributing" section
