## Development Workflow

We use a simplified Git Flow branching model designed for collaborative development while maintaining code quality and stability.

### Git Flow and Branching

#### Main Branches

- **`main`**: Production-ready codebase reflecting the latest stable release
- **`develop`**: Integration branch for development changes and new features

#### Branch Types and Naming Conventions

Create new branches from the latest `develop` or `main` branch using these naming conventions:

| Branch Type | Prefix | Example | Purpose |
|-------------|--------|---------|---------|
| Feature | `feat/` | `feat/tournament-brackets` | New feature implementations |
| Bug Fix | `fix/` | `fix/user-authentication` | Bug fixes and corrections |
| Styling | `styles/` | `styles/responsive-navbar` | UI/UX and styling improvements |
| Refactor | `refactor/` | `refactor/api-endpoints` | Code refactoring and optimization |

#### Branch Workflow

1. **Create a branch** from `develop` (or `main` for hotfixes):
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
3. **Commit your changes** using our commit message format
4. **Push your branch** to your fork
5. **Create a Pull Request** using our PR template

### Commit Message Guidelines

All commit messages **must** include both a gitmoji and a prefix to maintain consistency and clarity.

#### Format

```
<gitmoji> <PREFIX>: <short description>

<detailed description (optional)>
```

#### Prefixes and Gitmojis

| Gitmoji | Prefix | Usage |
|---------|--------|--------|
| ‚ú® | `FEAT` | New feature implementations |
| üêõ | `FIX` | Bug fixes and error corrections |
| üíÑ | `STYLES` | Styling, UI/UX, and responsiveness changes |
| üîß | `CHORE` | Configuration files and build process changes |
| üìù | `DOCS` | Documentation updates and improvements |
| ‚ôªÔ∏è | `REFACTOR` | Code refactoring without functional changes |
| üß™ | `TEST` | Adding or updating tests |
| üöÄ | `DEPLOY` | Deployment-related changes |
| üîí | `SECURITY` | Security-related improvements |

#### Examples

```bash
# Good commit messages
git commit -m "‚ú® FEAT: Add tournament bracket visualization" -m "Implemented interactive SVG-based tournament bracket with real-time updates and responsive design"

git commit -m "üêõ FIX: Resolve authentication redirect loop" -m "Fixed infinite redirect issue in Clerk authentication flow when users have incomplete profiles"

git commit -m "üíÑ STYLES: Improve mobile navigation experience" -m "Updated navbar to use hamburger menu on mobile devices with smooth animations"

# Bad commit messages (avoid these)
git commit -m "fix bug"
git commit -m "update code"
git commit -m "changes"
```

### Environment Configuration

Create appropriate `.env` files in both frontend and backend directories with required environment variables. Refer to the respective README files for specific configuration details.

## Code Style and Standards

### General Guidelines

- **Write clear, readable code** with meaningful variable and function names
- **Add comments** for complex logic and business rules
- **Follow established patterns** within the codebase
- **Keep functions small** and focused on a single responsibility
- **Use consistent formatting** as enforced by our linting tools

### Frontend (SvelteKit)

- Use **Biome** for code formatting and linting
- Follow **SvelteKit conventions** for file structure and naming
- Use **TypeScript** for type safety
- Write **accessible HTML** following WCAG guidelines
- Use **TailwindCSS** for styling with consistent design tokens

### Backend (Rust)

- Follow **Rust idioms** and best practices
- Use **cargo fmt** for code formatting
- Run **cargo clippy** for additional linting
- Write **comprehensive error handling**
- Document **public APIs** with doc comments

### Database

- Follow **SurrealDB schema conventions**
- Write **optimized queries** with proper indexing
- Document **schema changes** and migrations

## Testing Guidelines

We have comprehensive automated testing to ensure code quality and catch regressions early. All contributors should run tests before submitting PRs.

### Test Coverage Requirements

- **Minimum Coverage**: 70% line coverage for both frontend and backend
- **New Code**: Aim for 80%+ coverage on new features
- **Bug Fixes**: Must include regression tests
- **Critical Features**: Require comprehensive test coverage

### Frontend Testing

**Test Types:**
- **Unit Tests**: Vitest with browser environment for logic and utilities
- **Component Tests**: Svelte Testing Library for component behavior
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for full user workflows
- **Visual Tests**: Storybook for component development and visual regression

**Running Frontend Tests:**
```bash
cd front

# All tests (unit + e2e)
bun run test

# Unit tests only
bun run test:unit

# E2E tests only
bun run test:e2e

# Tests with coverage
bun run test:unit -- --coverage

# Storybook
bun run storybook
```

### Backend Testing

**Test Types:**
- **Unit Tests**: Native Rust testing for individual functions
- **Integration Tests**: Actix Web test utilities for API endpoints
- **Database Tests**: In-memory SurrealDB for data persistence
- **Mock Tests**: Wiremock for external service dependencies

**Running Backend Tests:**
```bash
cd back

# All tests
cargo test

# Tests with verbose output
cargo test --verbose

# Coverage report
cargo llvm-cov --html
```

### Test Requirements

- **All PRs** must have passing tests
- **New features** must include comprehensive tests
- **Bug fixes** must include regression tests
- **Test names** should clearly describe the scenario being tested
- **Tests should be reliable** and not flaky

## Automated Testing

### Continuous Integration

We use GitHub Actions for automated testing with multiple workflows:

#### 1. Pre-commit Quality Gates (`pre-commit.yml`)
Runs on every PR to ensure code quality:
- Code formatting and linting checks
- TypeScript type checking
- Commit message format validation
- File size and TODO comment checks

#### 2. Full CI Pipeline (`ci.yml`)
Comprehensive testing on `main` and `develop` branches:
- Frontend unit and E2E tests
- Backend tests with all features
- Storybook build verification
- Security audits
- Documentation link checking

#### 3. Coverage Reporting (`coverage.yml`)
Test coverage analysis and reporting:
- Coverage collection for both frontend and backend
- Coverage threshold enforcement (70% minimum)
- PR comments with coverage reports
- Codecov integration for detailed analysis

### Running CI Locally

Before pushing, simulate the CI environment:

```bash
# Frontend checks
cd front
bun run lint && bun run check && bun run test && bun run build

# Backend checks
cd back
cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy -- -D warnings && cargo test && cargo build --release
```

### Test Writing Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive test names**:
   ```typescript
   // ‚ùå Bad
   test('tournament test', () => { ... });

   // ‚úÖ Good
   test('should create tournament with valid participants', () => { ... });
   ```

2. **Follow AAA pattern** (Arrange, Act, Assert):
   ```typescript
   test('should calculate winner correctly', () => {
     // Arrange
     const tournament = createTestTournament();

     // Act
     const winner = tournament.calculateWinner();

     // Assert
     expect(winner).toBe('ExpectedWinner');
   });
   ```

3. **Test behavior, not implementation**:
   ```typescript
   // ‚ùå Testing implementation
   expect(component.internalState.count).toBe(5);

   // ‚úÖ Testing behavior
   expect(screen.getByText('Count: 5')).toBeVisible();
   ```

### Coverage Targets

- **Overall Project**: 70% minimum line coverage
- **New Features**: 80% coverage target
- **Critical Paths**: 90%+ coverage (authentication, data persistence)
- **Utilities/Helpers**: Near 100% coverage

## Documentation

### Types of Documentation

- **Code comments** for complex logic
- **README files** for setup and usage instructions
- **API documentation** maintained in APIdog
- **Testing documentation** in our [Testing Guide](./.github/TESTING.md)
- **Architecture documentation** for system design decisions

### Documentation Standards

- Keep documentation **up to date** with code changes
- Use **clear, concise language**
- Include **examples and code snippets**
- Consider **different audiences** (users, contributors, maintainers)
- **Test documentation examples** to ensure they work

### API Documentation

All API endpoints are documented in APIdog at: https://la-liga-de-los-muertos.apidog.io

When adding or modifying endpoints:
1. Update the APIdog documentation
2. Include request/response examples
3. Document error responses
4. Add authentication requirements
5. Include test examples for common use cases
